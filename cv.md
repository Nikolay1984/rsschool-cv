 ### Education 
 One year I is a partner in group [InSimpleWords](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBIKgIIjlHfLOL1bu9xnN-g). These people have 	everyday deep learning about Java Script 
Self-taught for a year and 9 months! Every day for 8 hours a day! In principle, I do not 	take part in the courses because I see no reason to pay for what I can find for free on 	the Internet!
<br>
 At first I was engaged in textbooks (like - [learn.javascript](https://learn.javascript.ru/) ), then I switched to 	the _documentation_ and _specification_!
  ### Languages
  I lived for one year in India, although there is not pure English, but people 	understood me well! Additionally, I continue to study English daily in depth. I can read, 	listen and translate well, I can speak and write too but with errors!
